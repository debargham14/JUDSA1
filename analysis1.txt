Analysis for problem1 (factorial by recursion and iteration)

OBSV1 :- Using int data type for calculating factorial results in correct outcome for values  <= 12 , from 13 onwards it results in a overflow (original value for 13 = 6,227,020,800 and value generated by code = 1932053504)

OBSV2 :- Using long long data type for calculating factorial results in correct outcome for values  <= 20 , from 21 onwards it results in a overflow (original value for 21 = 51,090,942,171,709,440,000 and value generated by code = -4249290049419214848)hmm
